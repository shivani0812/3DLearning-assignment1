In order to run **all the parts**, please execute the bash script as follows:

```bash
./main.sh
```

You will have to make the bash script an executable before you can run it. In order to do that, run this command first:

```bash
chmod +x main.sh
```

This creates a directory called **output** and stores all the rendered results in that folder.

In order to run each part individually, you can run the individual sections as follows:

```bash
python3 main.py -q 1.1
python3 main.py -q 1.2
python3 main.py -q 2.1
python3 main.py -q 2.2
python3 main.py -q 3
python3 main.py -q 4
python3 main.py -q 5.1
python3 main.py -q 5.2
python3 main.py -q 5.3
python3 main.py -q 6
python3 main.py -q 7
```
